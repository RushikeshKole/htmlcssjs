        <p>The pride of the Maratha Empire, the Pratapgarh Fort is a historical monument that welcomes all the people interested in knowing everything about the history of the fort. Perched in Satara district and at an altitude of 3500 feet above ground level, the Pratapgarh Fort was built by Maratha King – Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1656 to guard the Par Pass.</p>
        <p>Three years later, a major fight between the General of Bilaspur - Afzal Khan, and Shivaji happened here. Shivaji emerged as the winner at that time of the battle. However, in 1818, after losing the 3rd Anglo-Maratha war, the Marathas had to surrender it to the English East India Company. The Pratapgarh is categorized into 2 parts – the upper fort and the lower part. While the upper part of the fort is square in shape and 180 meters long from each side, the lower part of the fort is 320 meters long and 110 meters wide.</p>

        <p>The Pratapgarh Fort features the Mahadev Temple and Bhavani Temple along with a watchtower that is situated at its main entrance. Here you can also find a 17-feet tall statue of Shivaji Maharaj in its full glory. This statue was installed around 60 years back and it was finally unveiled by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on 30th November 1957.</p>
