        <p>Perched atop a hillock at an altitude of 1050 m, the Lohagad Fort separates the Indrayani basin from the Pawna basin. It is also among the popular trekking places to visit near Pune & Mumbai. It is one of the most visited forts in Maharashtra as part of Lonavala tour packages. The fort was built by Guru Govind Singh in 1564 CE to serve as a prison. Shivaji Maharaj captured it in 1648 CE, but he was forced to surrender it to the Mughals in 1665 CE by the Treaty of Purandar. Shivaji Maharaj recaptured the fort in 1670 CE and used it for keeping his treasury. Later in Peshwa's time, Nana Phadnavis used this fort for living and built several structures in the fort such as a big tank and a step-well. Recently the fort has been declared as a protected monument by the government.</p>
        <p>The hillfort is designed in the shape of the tail of a scorpion. The fort can be reached from any of its four entrances, namely Maha Darwaja, Ganesh Darwaja, Hanuman Darwaja and Narayan Darwaja. Exquisite sculpting can be seen on the Maha Darwaja and there is a small cave at the third gate which was initially used for storage of food material. All the four gates of the fort are still intact.</p>
