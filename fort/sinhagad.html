        <p>It is located in the Pune district in Maharashtra. The fort is also one of the famous forts in Maharashtra with a great history of Tanaji Malusare. The fort was captured by Tanaji Malusare and his brother. Sinhagad (Lion's Fort) was strategically built to provide natural protection from the enemies due to its very steep slopes. The walls of the fort and bastions were constructed only at key places. There are two gates to enter the fort named Kalyan Darwaja and Pune Darwaza. The Kalyan Darwaja is towards the southeast while the Pune Darwaza is towards the northeast.</p>
        <p>The fort is surrounded by several other forts and was known as the control center of the Maratha Empire. In clear weather, Rajgad, Purandar, and Torna forts can be seen from the Sinhagad killa.</p>
