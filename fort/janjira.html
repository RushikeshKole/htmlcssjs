        <p>Murud Janjira Fort is a mighty fortification located on an island off of the coastal village of Murud, 55 km from Alibag in Maharashtra. Towering up from a massive rock amidst the stretching azure of the Arabian Sea, this fort has stood the test of time as well as the test of resilience in the past. This fort is a must visit if you are travelling along the Konkan coast in Maharashtra. The fort, last revamped at the end of 17th century, still has most of its significant fortifications standing intact except a few ruins inside.</p>
        <p>The main attractions of the magnificent fort are the three colossal canons called Kalal Bangadi, Chavri and Landa Kasam. Once it stood firm and robust in defence with 572 roaring canons, but now only these three can be witnessed. Made of a mixture of five metals, the canons could shoot as much as 12 kilometres into the sea, as word of mouth goes.</p>

        <p>The Murud Janjira Fort has two significant doorways. The main entrance faces the jetty from where boats ferry people to and fro. This sizeable arched gate is flanked with motifs of mighty animals. On one side there were six elephants trapped by one tiger in its claws, and on the other side, two giant elephants were locking tusks as two lions stood at the side. The entranceway takes you to court or Durbar Hall which used to be a three-story structure, now a ruin. The other doorway to the west called the 'Darya Darwaza', which opens into the sea and was probably used as an emergency escape back in the days.</p>
